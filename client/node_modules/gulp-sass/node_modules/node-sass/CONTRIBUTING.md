## Contributing

The [`libsass` C++ library](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass) that this library binds to is not currently at feature parity with the [Ruby Gem](https://github.com/nex3/sass) that most Sass users will use. While we try our best to maintain feature parity with `libsass`, we can not enable features that have not been implemented in `libsass` yet.

If you'd like to see what features are still upcoming in `libsass`, [Jo Liss](http://twitter.com/jo_liss) has written [a recent blog post on the subject](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/01/state-of-libsass/).

Please check the [Issues on the `libsass` repo](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/issues) before opening an issue here, as there is a good chance that it may be an issue there for it. If not, then by all means, open an issue here and we'll look into it.
